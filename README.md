# About

A simple repository of code samples I've written to help me become more proficient at different programming languages. Could contain anything from simple notes on syntax and principles to /r/DailyProgrammer submissions. Some of it may not even be my code but a reference taken from Stack Overflow or a similar site. Enjoy!

## Current languages

* Elixir
